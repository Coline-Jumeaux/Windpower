    "The wind power production data is given as aggregates over each price region (SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4) in MWh/h. Since wind power capacity has grown over the course of the 24 months of competition data, a record of wind turbine installations is also provided. <br> This record is quality checked as best as possible but there might be discrepancies compared to reality. For example, according to the Swedish Wind Power Association there were 4099 wind turbines in Sweden constituting 8984 MW of installed capacity. In the record provided there are only 4004 wind turbines constituting 8640 MW of installed capacity. <br> It is anticipated that the provided wind turbine record could be useful in understanding geographical clusters of wind turbines as well as the growth of installed capacity."
